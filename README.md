This is my project for DIT2223 Mobile Application Assignment 1 for April 2024 in Sunway College. Using android native, java language.
The assignment is to make an easy small functional app, the app I made is a game called "Hangman", the app follows the game, where the user must guess an unknown word, by guessing characters of the word.
If the character is correct, the character is revealed in the word. If it is wrong, the hangman starts to appear, if the hangman fully appears, the user loses. Otherwise, the user gets to go to the next round.
This app only takes user input, through pressing buttons.
